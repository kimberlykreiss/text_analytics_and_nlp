# Text Analytics and NLP 

This repository contains code to analyze short text responses in both R and python.

The R programs focus more on text analytics and exploration of text data. Topics include word frequencies, bigram network analysis and part-of-speech tagging. 

The python programs use natural language processing techniques with machine learning algorithms to try to systematically extract information from responses.
